        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>In the Darwin region of the NT, bacterial black spot was initially identified in 1981. Since then, it has spread across the majority of the Top End's mango-growing regions.</p>
        <p>Black spot is caused by a bacterium known as <em>Xanthomonas campestris</em> pv. <em>mangiferae-indicae</em>. It can target berries, twigs, and leaves. Bacterial black spot often does not result in significant losses in the NT, but in some cases, it can.</p>
        <p>The severity of the sickness clearly fluctuates with the season. This agrees with reports from Queensland where the disease is most severe in southern areas but losses can occur in the north when unseasonal wet conditions occur during fruit development. Mango growing areas in the NT are fortunate in having no or little rain during fruit development.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The leaf dots appear higher and dark. Because the bigger veins limit them, they often have a curved form.</p>
        <p>Black and broken, twig and stem lesions can serve as a crucial survival strategy for the black spot bacteria.</p>
        <p>Fruit develops black, scabby patches, which frequently have star-shaped cracks inside. The edges of the spots are drenched with water.</p>

        <h2>Control</h2>
        <p>Bacterial black spot is managed with copper spray formulations, such as copper oxide or copper oxychloride. From blooming until fruit-set, they are administered every four weeks, with a one-day withholding period in between.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it is advised to use disease-free planting stock, prune diseased branches to improve airflow, sterilize tools, provide windbreaks to prevent wind damage and the spread of pathogens, and, if feasible, use resistant cultivars.</p>
