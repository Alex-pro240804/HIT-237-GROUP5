        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Anthracnose is a severe fungal disease of mangoes caused by <em>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</em> var. <em>minor</em>. It flourishes in damp, humid environments, particularly during flowering and fruit set, which may lead to fruit drop and harm to flowers. While it's less severe in the Northern Territory due to the dry season, it can still occur, particularly in ripening fruit. The fungus can cause latent infections in green fruit, remaining dormant until ripening triggers are observable. Wind and rain contribute to the disease's short-distance spread.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>On leaf edges, anthracnose produces tan to dark brown patches, particularly in wet conditions. In humid environments, young shoots may exhibit defoliation and darker tips. Early infections on fruit result in fruit drop and sunken dark blemishes. Lesions in young fruit can leak and have a glossy appearance. When latent infections manifest as grey-black patches with pink to orange spore masses on ripening fruit, this is the most typical symptom.</p>

        <h2>Control</h2>
        <p>Mancozeb should be sprayed on trees every 14 days after they blossom, avoiding application within 14 days of harvest, to control anthracnose. Prochloraz should be used sparingly in green fruit cases of severe illness in order to avoid resistance. For mango scab, copper sprays work well as well. Prochloraz cold sprays, hot water dips (which help prevent fruit flies and stem end rot), and hot benomyl dips are examples of post-harvest treatments.</p>
